We installed 25 ebullition traps across 5 transects in each impoundment. Every 3 hours, we recorded the volume of gas accumulated in each ebullition trap and took a diffusive flux measurement immediately adjacent to 10 if the ebullition traps across the impoundment. To determine impoundment area, I digitized the impoundments using high resolution (0.5 ft) orthoimagery captured during the leaf off period. Pick has a beaver dam on the inlet stream and I delineated only to the beaver dam.

From 6/20/22 to 7/13/22, we also recorded dissolved oxygen 0.1m from the bottom of Pick in the deepest location in the impoundment. Because dissolved oxygen was consistently 0 mg/L, we reallocated our oxygen sensors and installed both a top and bottom DO sensor in Sister 3. 1.1.1 Deans 1.1.2 Catfish 1.1.3 Sister 3 1.1.4 Pick 1.1.5 All impoundments top DO "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
